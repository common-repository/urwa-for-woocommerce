4. Drag the installed **WooCommerce Users by Role** display widget to the sidebar or widget area where you want your user role based widgets to appear.
5. Refresh your public site to see role based widgets and log out or log in as a different user role to see the widgets change. 


### Additional Usage - Shortcode

[woocommerce-user-role-widget-areas] 

### Additional Usage - Hardcoding

You can also hardcode the dynamic widget areas into your theme using the following PHP code.

The following code will display the role based widgets that you have defined on the Appearance > Widgets page in WordPress when placed in your theme:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[woocommerce-user-role-widget-areas]â€™); ?>` 


### Advanced Styling

Each role based widget area gets wrapped in a unique ID allowing advanced users to individually style the widget areas. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### FAQ

Q: I dragged widgets into the WooCommerce User Role Widget Areas but they are not showing up on the front end. Why?

A: You must make sure that you have placed the **WooCommerce Users By Role** widget into any existing **NON-USER** widget area where you want to display specific widgets based on user roles.

Q: I did the step above but the WooCommerce User Role widgets are still not showing up.

A: Make sure you have at least one widget in the widget area for the role you are logged in as. For example: If you are logged in as a Shop Manager drag a text widget into the Users - WooCommerce Shop Manager widget area and give it a title and some placeholder content. Go back to your browser and refresh.
